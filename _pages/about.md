I am a second-year PhD student at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. My mathematical interest lies in the intersection of number theory, algebraic geometry, and homotopy theory.

I was an undergraduate student at the University of Chicago from 2020 to 2024. Before that, I spent my high school years in the beautiful city of [Maastricht](https://www.holland.com/upload_mm/d/f/c/69557_fullimage_sint-servaas-brug-maas-maastricht-stad-eighty8things-1360%20copy.jpg), the Netherlands. Before that, I lived a happy life in [Hefei](https://cdn.britannica.com/58/138758-050-E5300BEB/Hefei-Anhui-China.jpg), China.

Here is my [cv](https://yunhansheng.github.io/files/cv.pdf). You can reach me at: yhsheng at umich dot edu.

Expository writings
======
**Notes on real orientations**. [pdf](https://yunhansheng.github.io/files/real.pdf)\
I intend to explain in detail the results and argument of the paper _Real orientaions of Lubin-Tate spectra_ by Jeremy Hahn and XiaoLin Danny Shi. It also contains an exposition on the Ando-Blumberg-Gepner-Hopkins-Rezk construction of the Thom spectra functor.

**Cofreeness of Lubin-Tate theory**. [pdf](https://yunhansheng.github.io/files/cofree.pdf)\
Final paper written for the 2023 UChicago REU. This article is a detailed survey of Section 3 of the 2020 paper _The chromatic Nullstellensatz_ by Burklund, Schlank, and Yuan. It aims to prove that at the level of algebras, Lubin-Tate theory _E_ is cofree, i.e., right adjoint to some forgetful functor forgetting the structure of power operations. This builds on my previous notes on power operations. 

**Power operations and HKR character theory**. [pdf](https://yunhansheng.github.io/files/power.pdf)\
These are some notes I took while reading Stapleton's survey paper _Lubin-Tate theory, character theory, and power operations_. It is about extending the power operations on Morava _E_-theory to the codomain of the Hopkins-Kuhn-Ravenel character map. Important results by Strickland and Ando-Hopkins-Strickland on the moduli-theoretic interpretation of Lubin-Tate theory are also introduced.

**Phylogenetic Treespace**. [pdf](https://yunhansheng.github.io/files/tree.pdf)\
Slides of a participant talk given at the 2023 PCMI Undergraduate Summer School. It is based on the paper _Geometry of the Space of Phylogenetic Trees_ by Billera, Holmes, and Vogtmann.

**Complex multiplication of elliptic curves and abelian varieties**. [pdf](https://yunhansheng.github.io/files/complexmultiplication.pdf)\
Final paper written for the 2022 UChicago REU.

**Complex Multiplication**. [pdf](https://yunhansheng.github.io/files/REU_presentation__Copy_.pdf)\
Slides of a participant talk given at the 2022 UChicago REU.

**On realizing rational and polynomial cohomology rings**. [pdf](http://math.uchicago.edu/~may/REU2021/REUPapers/Sheng.pdf)\
Final paper written for the 2021 UChicago REU. This paper focuses on the following _inverse cohomology_ problem: which graded _R_-algebras can be realized as the cohomology ring (with coefficients in _R_) of a topological space? I explain in detail the 1976 paper of Bousfield and Gugenheim, _On PL de Rham Theory and Rational Homotopy Type_, which solves the problem for _R_ is the ring of rational numbers. The paper uses Quillen's model categories in an essential way.

**Elements of complex K-theory**. [pdf](https://yunhansheng.github.io/files/K-theory.pdf)\
I focused on explaning how topological K-theory is related to singular cohomology via three things: Chern characters, the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence, and the Adams operation.

**Kähler manifolds and Hodge theory**. [pdf](https://yunhansheng.github.io/files/hodge.pdf)\
I wrote about the basics of complex and Kähler manifolds, and outlined a proof of Hodge decomposition assuming the regularity lemma from functional analysis. I also discussed some applications of Hodge theory.

**Brownian motion and stochastic calculus**. [pdf](https://yunhansheng.github.io/files/385notes.pdf)\
Class notes for the course _Brownian motion and stochastic calculus*_ with Prof. Greg Lawler.

Miscellaneous
=====
I play piano, organ, and [carillon](https://rockefeller.uchicago.edu/the-carillon). You can access some of my recordings on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8rZi3endlvKFcRgIQ51D9A) or [Bilibilibi](https://space.bilibili.com/350146251). Here are some recent ones:

J. S. Bach: [Prelude and Fugue in E Major from WTC Book II (BWV 878)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dP7I1RQTZa4)\
Gubaidulina: [Chaconne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuwyZMN-AC8)\

I am broadly interested in philosophy (Aristotle, Hegel, and Kierkegaard etc.). I often find connections between music and philosophy, so I write them down when I get a chance. They are mostly in Chinese, although I do plan to write in English in the future. Here are some of them:

A Hegelian phenomenological interpretation of Beethoven's piano sonata Op. 110.\
[追寻钟声的脚步](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/GmaqEDY9dhYV3VYhS5qB7w)\
A Documentation of my trip to Europe where I played on different caillons.\
[幻想曲式：北德管风琴学派与巴赫](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/_mw-4QJDOKoSm0dVjGMLqg)\
